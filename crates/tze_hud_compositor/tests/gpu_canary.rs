//! GPU availability canary — always-on test that enforces the GPU contract.
//!
//! ## Purpose
//!
//! Compositor GPU tests silently self-skip (bare `return`) when no wgpu adapter
//! is found or `TZE_HUD_SKIP_GPU_TESTS=1` is set.  On a host that is supposed
//! to have a GPU (real or software), a silently-skipped suite is
//! indistinguishable from a passing one, which masks regressions (see hud-2sxfk,
//! hud-5jbra).
//!
//! This module provides a single **always-on** canary test:
//!
//! - If `TZE_HUD_REQUIRE_GPU=1` is set, the test asserts a wgpu adapter IS
//!   available.  Failure is loud and CI-blocking.
//! - If the variable is absent (normal dev / headless builds) the test passes
//!   immediately — no GPU required.
//!
//! ## CI integration
//!
//! Set `TZE_HUD_REQUIRE_GPU=1` in any CI job that installs Mesa / llvmpipe or
//! runs on a GPU-enabled runner.  The canary will then fail the job if the
//! adapter disappears (e.g. missing mesa-vulkan-drivers, broken llvmpipe build).
//!
//! ## Skip contract
//!
//! `TZE_HUD_SKIP_GPU_TESTS=1` is intentionally honoured: if the operator
//! explicitly opts out of GPU tests, the canary does not override that choice.
//! `TZE_HUD_REQUIRE_GPU=1` and `TZE_HUD_SKIP_GPU_TESTS=1` are mutually
//! exclusive; setting both is a misconfiguration caught by a separate assertion.
