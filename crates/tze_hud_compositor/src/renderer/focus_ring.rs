//! Keyboard focus-ring owner plumbing for the chrome-layer ring pass (hud-k6yvb).
//!
//! The runtime's `FocusManager` owns keyboard focus; the compositor draws the
//! ring. Node-level focus is visible to the compositor via
//! `hit_region_states.focused`, but a **tile-level** focus stop (a non-passthrough
//! tile with no focusable nodes) has no scene representation, so the compositor
//! cannot see it. Rather than special-case only what the scene exposes, the
//! runtime plumbs the current focus owner here and the compositor draws the ring
//! for ANY owner — tile-level or node, in any tile — in a single chrome-layer
//! pass above all agent content (input-model §416).
